    "bodyHTML": "<p>If there is one prediction of the future that is certain, it is the fact that the world’s population is ageing. Projections show that the majority of the population of developed countries will be 40 years old by 2030, 52 in Japan. This is also happening in most developing countries.<br/><br/>Even China’s ageing population is “catching up” with the developed world. At the same time, whilst populations are getting older, more and more of us are living in cities. Such urbanisation is seemingly creating significant economic benefits. However, instead of megacities, future economies will most likely be driven by the middle-sized cities. The result is that the powerful economic players could still be relatively unknown today.<br/><br/>European countries have <strong>high life expectancies and low fertilities</strong>, creating challenges for social security and pensions, leading to insufficient labour forces to support the old-age pensioners.  Continuous investments will therefore drive economic growth. <strong><br/><br/>Related is urbanisation</strong>, and countries with the highest urbanisation ratios and populations are showing the greatest GDPs per head.  Currently, the top-performing middleweight cities outperform most megacities in household growth and income potential, making them attractive business prospects, and 577 such fast-changing cities globally will make greater economic contributions. <strong><br/><br/>Higher populations create consumption</strong>, leading to more income. Also, clusters form around cities, with distinct economic characteristics, opening up opportunities to reach new customers; e.g., clusters around 14 Indian cities will access 40% of the 2030 market.</p>",
