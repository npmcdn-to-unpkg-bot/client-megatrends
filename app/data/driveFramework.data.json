    "bodyHTML": "<p>If there is one prediction of the future that is certain, it is the fact that the world’s population is aging. Both developed and developing countries are experiencing aging populations, leading to shrinking populations of young people. Projections show that the majority of people in developed countries will be over 40 years old by 2030 – over 52 in Japan. While China has a younger population (averaging 35.4) today than the United States (37.4), by 2030 these averages will be 42.1 and 39.5 – China’s aging population is ‘catching up’ with the developed world. <br/><br/>With the exception of Japan, South Korea and Cuba, all aging countries are in Europe, and are the result of the combination of very high life expectancy and very low fertility rates. This creates challenges for social security systems and the financing of pensions. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the most youthful are the developing countries of the Sub-Saharan region, and are the result of very low levels of life expectancy and very high levels of fertility. This creates challenges for educating the population and providing them with employment. <br/><br/>This means that the world’s population will plateau for the first time in human history, creating an insufficient labour force to support old-age pensioners. With the labour pool shrinking, the only way to increase economic growth is through continuous investments. The past shows that productivity significantly increases in industries that are not protected, which means that governments need to introduce more liberal competition prices. <br/><br/>Related to this growth and change are the ways such populations are living, with city and town populations growing – a process known as urbanisation. Greater urbanisation appears to have a positive effect on GDP development, and countries with the highest urbanisation ratios are showing the greatest GDP per head of the population. This is probably the reason why China, with an urbanisation ratio of 50 per cent in 2010, is keen to push it to 60 per cent in the next decade, giving its cities more importance in economic development. <br/><br/>Megacities – urban areas with populations of 10 million or more – have not been driving growth for the past 15 years, and are expected to account for only 10 per cent of global growth in 10 years’ time, as opposed to 16 per cent today. However, countries with high populations and levels of urbanisation tend to have the strongest GDP growth. <br/><br/>At present, and importantly for future development, the top-performing middleweight cities outperform most megacities in terms of household growth and long-term income potential, making them attractive prospects for businesses. In all, globally, 577 such fast-changing cities will play a much more important role in terms of economic contributions. <br/><br/>The two major implications for urbanisation are the boost in consumption resulting from the higher populations, which in turn creates more income and fuels further consumption, and the creation of clusters around cities, each with distinct characteristics with regards to wealth, consumption profiles, consumer attitudes and market dynamics, which creates new market opportunities due to the proximity to regional markets, allowing companies to easily reach new customer bases in smaller cities and rural areas. For example, clusters around 14 cities of India will be able to access 40 per cent of the Indian market by 2030.</p>",
    "intro": "At the centre of any future scenario is people. How our state of living will evolve very much depends on many events happening today.

    "bodyHTML": "<p>The growth of consuming populations and their concentration into certain areas creates a greater reliance on available resources, and resource scarcity is the second aspect that the DRIVE framework predicts for expanding urban areas. This is likely to manifest itself as the following five problems: <br/><br/>(a) Availability of sufficient resources – for example, the availability and quality of water services, due to changes in the groundwater level and pollution. <br/><br/>(b) Ensuring a reliable energy supply – cities will consume three-quarters of the total energy supply by 2030, and will need to meet this demand while keeping their carbon emissions low. <br/><br/>(c) The difficulty in controlling crime and maintaining security with the expansion of low-income populations. <br/><br/>(d) There will be 1.7 billion vehicles worldwide by 2030, adding pressure to controlling congestion and pollution. <br/><br/>(e) Uncontrollable amounts of waste resulting from the growth of industry and changing consumer behaviour. <br/><br/>Energy tends to be considered the most important resource, and there are no signs to suggest that our supplies are running out any time soon. However, despite the still-huge reserves of fossil fuels, their exploitation is costly and environmentally damaging. The solution is to use solar energy and other renewables, which are abundant enough to satisfy growing demand. <br/><br/>Water presents more of a problem. Global demand will increase 40 per cent by 2050, and cities may experience difficulties maintaining their supply and sanitation requirements. <br/><br/>Related to water, food is also under pressure. As more people in emerging markets can afford greater amounts of meat, this creates a larger demand for water in agriculture. Inevitably, increasing food prices will take up greater proportions of personal income, especially in developing countries. <br/><br/>The growth of economies has also been surprisingly wasteful, relying on a ‘take-make-dispose’ approach. Currently, only 40 per cent of used materials are recycled, with the rest landfilled or incinerated, and Europe wastes around 95 per cent of its raw materials’ original value, generally using materials only once. Our mobility, food and building systems also have deeply ingrained wasting habits. This can be combatted by creating circular economy practices, wherein assets can be shared and product performance enhanced – lowering waste creation while allowing existing waste to be remanufactured and repurposed.</p>",
    "intro": "People live on inputs – more precisely, a constant supply of inputs at acceptable prices. People, together with their social composition, have an enormous impact on the resources of our planet, often shaping new geographies.

    "bodyHTML": "<p>The gap between rich and poor in countries like the United States is growing rapidly, where the top 1 per cent earn 19 per cent of its total income. In fact, the top 0.1 per cent hold almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 per cent. China, meanwhile, ranks very low in terms of the world’s richest countries, yet has the second highest number of billionaires in the world, the richest 10 per cent controlling a greater share of wealth than in the US. <br/><br/>Productivity and GDP have continued to grow worldwide, while job prospects and income have faltered. Computers and robotics are gradually replacing the lower-skilled workers, while corporate profits have been rising for the same reason, making this growing digitalisation positive for workers with special skills and education. <br/><br/>As inequality becomes more pronounced, the middle class is being hollowed out, and is shrinking. In the US, the percentage of households earning 50 per cent of the average income has decreased from 56.5 per cent to 45.1 per cent between 1979 and 2012. <br/><br/>Another reason for increasing wealth inequality is the role that capital plays. Traditionally, the retail sector has driven the financial sector, but increasingly the reverse is true, with financial holdings and assets growing while ‘real’ asset bases and total GDPs are shrinking. It is expected that a $27 trillion GDP growth will therefore be supported by a $300 trillion growth of financial assets, meaning there will be a lot more capital available. <br/><br/>It is likely that most of the new capital created will come from China, which would, at the same time, be chasing a decreasing number of investment opportunities.</p>",

IT has increased this growth in the last three decades, now that all parts of the world can reach each other in seconds. This leads to the fourth DRIVE aspect – Volatility, Scale and Complexity. <br/><br/>The factors of traditional production are less important, land use reducing in importance, and capital increasing. Added to this is the rise of the Middle East and China as the centres of global economics. Meanwhile, diversification is diminishing in importance, as our highly connected world means that assets across the world share the same systemic risk.<br/><br/>These new dynamics create a new globalisation of increased opportunities and unexpected volatility, and make the future situation difficult to predict using traditional forecasting models. Our ability to measure volatility is out of sync with reality, as we tend to see it in statistical terms of likelihood.</p>",

    "bodyHTML": "<p>Technologies are not just fundamentally changing the way we live; they are also reshaping businesses’ work. New models of doing business are emerging at breakneck speed. Despite its growing importance, China is often viewed as a country unable to innovate. Yet, in customer-focused and efficiency-driven innovations, it has been doing business at such levels of novelty that Western companies should take it as a reference.<br/><br/>Companies of all sizes are taking on new and different entrepreneurial dynamics. With the rise of automation and robotics, many companies, large and small, are now departing from their traditional core business to become IT companies with business expertise. For instance, a translation company told us that it is now more of an IT integrator with a small set of translation activities. A multinational service company in the insurance industry mentioned to us that it intends to become a data company, as if it stayed just a service provider it would gradually lose out to the market. Technological platforms have also enabled individuals and companies to speed up product development, target demand with laser precision and manage the financial side of business differently, amongst other improvements.<br/><br/>The speed of change quickens its pace through the declining end of the company lifecycle. Like the Red Queen in the novel Through the Looking Glass, businesses have to invest a great deal of resources just to stay in the same place. To stay ahead of the curve, they have little choice but to think ahead to identify new opportunities. By anticipating what could be coming, they can start thinking about what to do next. Being slicker today means getting to do new things quicker.</p>",
